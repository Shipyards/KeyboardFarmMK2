ZTRFIO - ZTR engine file abstraction
Binary only

This class is the ZTR engine's file manager system, it opens a Fstream to the files and absracts all reading and writing to the file.

Notes:
as of 12/26/2023 ZTFIO lacks multithreaded compaltibility (in-progress)
Fstream only has one pointer that is used by both the read and write function; ZTRFIO abstracts the read and write pointers

member variables:
public std::string filename | stores the actual name of the file ex. "example.bin"
private std::streampos lastpos | stores last stream positon after moving the pointer
private std::streampos writepos | stores abstract positon of the write pointer
private std::streampos readpos | stores the abstract position of the read pointer


member functions:
constructor(std::string filenamein) | will add ".bin" to the end of the string if the 4th from last character isn't '.'
deconstuctor()
[stream pointer manager functions]
void ptr_tostart() | moves the Fstream pointer to the start of the file, saves last position
void ptr_toend() | moves the Fstream pointer to the end of the file, saves last position
void ptr_toread() | moves the Fstream pointer to the read position, saves last position
void ptr_towrite() | mvoes the Fstream pointer to the write position, savles last position
